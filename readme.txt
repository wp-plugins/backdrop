Backdrop is an improved site background customizer allowing for all manner of fancy things.

== Description ==

Backdrop is a site background customizer with power greater than the mere stock background selector included with wordpress. What can backdrop do that the default can't? I'm glad you asked...

+ More than just boring backgrounds, flexible backgrounds and parallex backgrounds are stuffed in here too (don't worry, the boring ones are still around as well).
+ Options, options, options! More options that you can shake a well sharpened stick at.
+ Who said background had to scroll up when you scroll down, make it left right, or even up and to the right if you want.
+ One click retina backgrounds, make it look all purdy on that fancy screen.
+ Theme schmeme, we don't need support in your stinkin theme, backdrop can (and sometimes has to) force it's way into nearly any theme.
+ Built with efficiency in mind, adds only what it needs to work, and uses cachable styles and script automagically generated by the plugin.

_Note: Backdrop totally ditches those stock customizable backgrounds to work it's kung-fu, while it works most of the time it may not work for you, if this is the case let me know and I'll see if I get jimmy it in there for you._

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `backdrop` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
