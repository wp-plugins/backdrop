<h2 class="title">Advanced Settings</h2>
<p>
	Backdrop has some additional, more advanced options you can adjust. Sometimes when adjusting these options things 
	may behave in an unexpected manner. Support for the advanced settings is limited, however since they interface more 
	directly with the style sheet if you are familiar  with CSS you should have little trouble with it. You can enable or 
	disable advanced settings at any time with the button below.
</p>
<form method="post" action="">
	<p class="submit">
		<?php if(get_option('backdrop-advanced','disabled')=='disabled'){
			echo '<input type="submit" name="enable_advanced" class="button button-secondary" value="Enable Advanced Settings" />';
		}else{
			echo '<input type="submit" name="disable_advanced" class="button button-secondary" value="Disable Advanced Settings" />';
		} ?>
	</p>
</form>
<p>
	At the top of the Backdrop panel there is a new message about how to view the generated style sheets. These links 
	generate the stylesheets and currently being used on your live site, not the ones being used to generate the preview 
	to the right of the customizer. This can be changed by adding <code>&use_session=true</code> to the URL. If you are 
	having in problems with Backdrop please include both your Generated CSS and Generated JS files when contating me so 
	I can better diagnose the problem.
</p>

	<table class="form-table">

			<tr valign="top">
				<th scope="row">Applied To</th>
				<td>
					<p>
						The element you want the backdrop styles applied to. By default they are applied to <code>#backdrop-element</code>, 
						a div added into the page by the plugin. You can apply the styles and effects to multiple 
						elements if you'd like the same way you would apply a style to multiple elements. When the 
						javascript is run each element is grabbed with <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code>. 
						positioning is applied on an element by element basis, adjusting for the elements relative 
						position on the page with <code>getBoundingClientRect()</code>. Keep in mind that because the 
						position is calculated for each element selecting a large number of elements may have a 
						performance impact. Also, even though the initial background position is calculated on an 
						element by element basis the scroll position is determined at the window level, not an 
						individual scroll position that a given element may have.

		Advanced settings have been tested, although not as thoroughly as the basic ones. If you experience an issue 
		when using the advanced settings please let me know and I will try to look into a solution. If you experience 
		any odd behavior when using the advanced settings you can reset to a basic stock installation with the button 
		below. This will not disable advanced mode, simply reset it. Advanced mode can be disabled using the same button 
		you use to enable it.
